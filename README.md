The "Idea Chronicler" project is a blog application that serves as a classic example of a blog website. This fully functional website allows users to explore a list of posts and actively engage with them by leaving comments and liking posts. The application's primary goal is to provide a platform where users can share ideas, insights, and opinions through written content and interact with other users' posts.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## 🚀 Getting Started<a name="getting-started"></a>

### Setup 🔧<a name="setup"></a>

1. Ensure you have Ruby installed on your system. You can check your Ruby version in the terminal by running:

```
ruby -v
```

If Ruby is not installed, you can download and install it from the official Ruby website.

2. Ensure you have Ruby on Rails (RoR) installed on your system. You can check your Rails version in the terminal by running:

```
rails -v
```

If Rails is not installed, you can install it using the following command:

```
gem install rails
```

3. To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.
Choose the directory on your local machine where you want to copy project. For example:

```
cd /home/user/name-of-your-directory
```

Clone the project using one of the options.

Using SSH-key:

```
git clone git@github.com:romans-adi/IdeaChronicler.git
```
Using HTTPS:

```
git clone https://github.com/romans-adi/IdeaChronicler.git
```

You can also create the new directory just adding the name of it in the end of command. For example:

```
git clone https://github.com/romans-adi/IdeaChronicler.git IdeaChronicler
```
### Installation ⚙️<a name="installation"></a>

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where you have cloned or downloaded the IdeaChronicler repository.

3. Run the following command to install any required dependencies:
```bundle install```

### Usage 🧰<a name="usage"></a>

1. Once the setup is complete, ensure you are still in the directory containing the IdeaChronicler files.

2. To set up the database and seed initial data, run the following commands:

```
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed
```

This will create the database, apply migrations, and populate the database with sample data.

3. To precompile assets for production deployment, execute the following command:

```
rails assets:precompile
```

Precompiling assets is essential for improved performance and loading times in a production environment.

4. To run the app in development mode, execute the following command:

```
rails server
```

3. The app will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

4. If you have future features like GUI or interactive mode, follow the specific instructions provided for those features in the app's documentation.

### Troubleshooting :nut_and_bolt:<a name="troubleshooting"></a>

If you encounter any issues related to missing assets or unexpected behavior after making changes, try the following steps:

1. Delete the `tmp` directory located in the root of your project:

```
rm -rf tmp/
```

This can help clear any cached data that might be causing issues.

2. Delete the `public/assets` directory:

```
rm -rf public/assets/
```
This ensures that any previously precompiled assets are removed, and new ones will be generated during the next precompilation.

3. If problems persist, you can refer to the official [Ruby on Rails Guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) for more troubleshooting tips and guidance.

### Tests :heavy_check_mark:<a name="tests"></a>

To run the tests for the Solver class, ensure you are in the directory containing the test files.

1. Install RSpec:

Find your gemfile and add the RSpec gem in the development, test group:

```
group :development, :test do
  gem 'rspec-rails'
end
```

2. Then in your terminal run the command:

```
bundle install
```

3. To set up RSpec in your app and create the Spec folder run:

```
rails generate rspec:install
```

4. Run the tests for all the models using the following command:

```
rspec spec/models
```

5. Alternatively, you could run tests for any specific suit using the following command (an example for Like model):

```
rspec spec/models/like_spec.rb
```

6. All tests should pass without any errors or failures, ensuring that all models and their methods are functioning correctly.
