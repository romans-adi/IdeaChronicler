# <a name="about-project"> Idea Chronicler </a>

The "Idea Chronicler" project is a blog application that serves as a classic example of a blog website. This fully functional website allows users to explore a list of posts and actively engage with them by leaving comments and liking posts. The application's primary goal is to provide a platform where users can share ideas, insights, and opinions through written content and interact with other users' posts.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## üöÄ Getting Started<a name="getting-started"></a>

### Setup üîß<a name="setup"></a>

1. Ensure you have Ruby installed on your system. You can check your Ruby version in the terminal by running:

```
ruby -v
```

If Ruby is not installed, you can download and install it from the official Ruby website.

2. Ensure you have Ruby on Rails (RoR) installed on your system. You can check your Rails version in the terminal by running:

```
rails -v
```

If Rails is not installed, you can install it using the following command:

```
gem install rails
```

3. To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.
Choose the directory on your local machine where you want to copy project. For example:

```
cd /home/user/name-of-your-directory
```

Clone the project using one of the options.

Using SSH-key:

```
git clone git@github.com:romans-adi/IdeaChronicler.git
```
Using HTTPS:

```
git clone https://github.com/romans-adi/IdeaChronicler.git
```

You can also create the new directory just adding the name of it in the end of command. For example:

```
git clone https://github.com/romans-adi/IdeaChronicler.git IdeaChronicler
```
### Installation ‚öôÔ∏è<a name="installation"></a>

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where you have cloned or downloaded the IdeaChronicler repository.

3. Run the following command to install any required dependencies:
```bundle install```

### Usage üß∞<a name="usage"></a>

1. Once the setup is complete, ensure you are still in the directory containing the IdeaChronicler files.

2. To set up the database and seed initial data, run the following commands:

```
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
```

This will create the database and apply migrations.

If you want to populate the database you can run (this step is not required):

```
rails db:seed
```

3. To precompile assets for production deployment, execute the following command:

```
rails assets:precompile
```

Precompiling assets is essential for improved performance and loading times in a production environment.

4. To run the app in development mode, execute the following command:

```
rails server
```

5. The app will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

6. When a user signs up, Devise will automatically send a confirmation email with a verification link. You can find the confirmation link in the Rails logs. For example:

```
<p>Welcome john@mail.com!</p>

<p>You can confirm your account email through the link below:</p>

<p><a href="http://localhost:3000/verification?confirmation_token=T8CsCpr_YbMGSjZ7sUgz">Confirm my account</a></p>

```

  Users need to click on the confirmation link to verify their email address and activate their account. After verifying their email, users can log in and access the application's features.

  If you encounter any issues with the email verification process, please refer to the Devise documentation or seek assistance from the Devise community.

7. If you have future features like GUI or interactive mode, follow the specific instructions provided for those features in the app's documentation.

### API :end: <a name="api"></a>

The IdeaChronicler API allows you to interact with user data, posts, and comments. You can use this API to retrieve information about users, posts, and comments, as well as create new users and comments.

How to Use:

Start your local server by running
```
rails s
```

Access the API documentation at

```
http://localhost:3000/api-docs/
```

To gain permission for using API requests, you must be registered and verified. To receive a token permitting API usage, you need to send a POST request using the following endpoint:

```
http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/login
```

The request must include your login and password in the request body.

In the response body, you will receive an authorization token, which you can use for subsequent requests.

Example response:

```
{"token":"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo5LCJleHAiOjE2OTQzNjgwMTN9.FeDwYMzJe4zTSJjNQgIdYtyzQYPJ-nZ6GXPTJx6TqLw"}
```

Once you've received the token, you must specify it in the header with the name "Authorization" as the key and use your token as the value.

Example CURL request:

```
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "comment": {
      "text": "This is your comment text."
    }
  }' \
  http://localhost:3000/api/v1/users/USER_ID/posts/POST_ID/comments
```


You will find five main API requests:

```
List of Users: Retrieve a list of users.
Endpoint: /api/v1/users
Method: GET
```

```
Create User: Create a new user.
Endpoint: /api/v1/users
Method: POST
Request Body: JSON with email, password and password confirmation (same as password) fields.
```

```
List of Posts: Retrieve a list of posts.
Endpoint: /api/v1/posts
Method: GET
```

```
List of Comments: Retrieve a list of comments.
Endpoint: /api/v1/comments
Method: GET
```

To try out these requests, use the provided API documentation at http://localhost:3000/api-docs/. You can make requests directly from the documentation interface.

Make sure to include the required request parameters, such as the request body for creating a new user or comment, and review the expected responses.

Experiment and interact with the API to better understand its functionality.

Note: Ensure that you have the Rails server running locally, and you can access the API documentation through the provided link. This documentation will guide you on how to use the API and test its endpoints effectively.


### Troubleshooting :nut_and_bolt:<a name="troubleshooting"></a>

#### Rendering

If you encounter any issues related to missing assets or unexpected behavior after making changes, try the following steps:

1. Delete the `tmp` directory located in the root of your project:

```
rm -rf tmp/
```

This can help clear any cached data that might be causing issues.

2. Delete the `public/assets` directory:

```
rm -rf public/assets/
```
This ensures that any previously precompiled assets are removed, and new ones will be generated during the next precompilation.

#### Database

 If you encounter any problems related to data or database inconsistencies, you can follow these steps to reset your database:

1. Ensure Server/Process Shutdown: Make sure that your Rails server or any related processes are not running. You should not have any active connections to the database.

2. Drop the Database:

```
rake db:drop
```

or

```
rails db:drop
```

3. Recreate the Database [how to](#usage)

After dropping the database, you can recreate it from scratch. Run migrations to set up the schema.

If problems persist, you can refer to the official [Ruby on Rails Guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) for more troubleshooting tips and guidance.

### Tests :heavy_check_mark:<a name="tests"></a>

To run the tests for the IdeaChronicler requests and models, ensure you are in the directory containing the test files.

1. Install RSpec:

Find your gemfile and add the RSpec gem in the development, test group:

```
group :development, :test do
  gem 'rspec-rails'
end
```

2. Then in your terminal run the command:

```
bundle install
```

3. To set up RSpec in your app and create the Spec folder run:

```
rails generate rspec:install
```

4. Run the tests for all the models using the following command:

```
rspec spec/models
```

5. Alternatively, you could run tests for any specific suit using the following command (an example for Like model):

```
rspec spec/models/like_spec.rb
```

6. All tests should pass without any errors or failures, ensuring that all models and their methods are functioning correctly.
